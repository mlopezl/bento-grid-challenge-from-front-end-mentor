## Overview
This project is a responsive Bento grid layout consisting of 8 cards. Each card contains an image, a title, and in some cases, a description. The layout adapts to different screen sizes, rearranging the cards for optimal viewing on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## The challenge
Users should be able to:
- View the optimal grid layout depending on their device's screen size.
- See a visually appealing arrangement of cards inspired by the original design.
- Access all content in a clear and responsive manner.
